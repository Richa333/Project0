      <h3>Straight Hair</h3>
      <p>Typically known as Type 1, falls smoothly and has a sleek feel since the natural oils from the scalp easily work their way to the bottom. Straight hair doesn't need much conditioning because it's typically soft and smooth. But that doesn't mean you can't suffer from common problems like flatness at the top, weak and stringy hair and your hair getting greasy more quickly.</p>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3>Wavy Hair</h3>
      <p> Typically known as type 2, has s-shaped curls down its length, it's the perfect blend between straight and curly. Sometimes the hair can appear straight with slight bends towards the ends of the hair, or it can have consistent waves throughout the shaft. This hair has ultimate flexibility, and is easy to straighten, keep wavy, curl and style. However, sometimes it can get greasy on the top and dry at the bottom, and is much more prone to frizz than other types.</p>

      <h3>Curly Hair</h3>
      <p>Typically known as type 3, is bouncy, playful, and full of volume. The strand thickness can range from fine to coarse but is most often fine. The greatest challenges for curly hair types are frizz, lack of shine, lack of curl definition, shrinkage and dryness.</p>
