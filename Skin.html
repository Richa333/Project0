      <h3>Dry Skin</h3>
      <p>Dry skin isn't usually serious. In most cases it's caused by factors like hot or cold weather, low moisture in the air, and soaking in hot water. You can do a lot on your own to improve your skin, including using moisturizers and avoiding harsh, drying soaps. But sometimes dry skin happens often or is severe.</p>

      <h3>Oily Skin</h3>
      <p>Oily skin is the result of the overproduction of sebum from sebaceous glands. These glands are located under the skin's surface. Sebum is an oily substance made of fats. Sebum isn't all bad since it helps protect and moisturize your skin and keep your hair shiny and healthy.</p>

      <h3>Combination Skin</h3>
        <p>Combination skin is simply having oily skin in some areas of your face and dry skin in other areas. Typically, there's a mix of oily and dry areas on different parts of your face, with the t-zone (forehead, nose, and chin) being slightly to very oily.</p>
